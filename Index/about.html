        <p align="center">Food is one of the basic necessities of life. Food contains nutrientsâ€”substances essential for the growth, repair, and maintenance of body tissues and for the regulation of vital processes. Nutrients provide the energy our bodies need to function. The energy in food is measured in units called calories.</p>
        <p align="center">In this world there are a lot people dying with hunger.Poor nutrition and hunger is responsible for the death of 3.1 million children a year. That's nearly half of all deaths in children under the age of 5.</p>
        <p align="center"><b>So we don't want to waste the food,if we have more than enough food donate it to the people who are with hunger.FEED OTHERS TOO</b></p>
